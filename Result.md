### Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
### Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
### Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
### Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
### Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
### Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
### Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


## Part II - VacationPy

1. Humidity over entire city

2. Hotel locations from searching by weather conditions

As final considerations:

* You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
* You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
* For Part I, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* For Part II, you must include a screenshot of the heatmap you create and include it in your submission.
* You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
* For max intensity in the heat map, try setting it to the highest humidity found in the data set.
